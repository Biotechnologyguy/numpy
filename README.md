# NumPy Learning Notebooks ðŸ“’

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks with various aspects of using the NumPy library in Python. Each notebook is self-contained and focuses on a specific topic within NumPy, starting from the basics and moving towards more complex operations.

## Notebooks

1. **What is NumPy in Python?**  
   Introduction to NumPy and its significance in scientific computing.

2. **NumPy Array vs Python List**  
   A comparison between NumPy arrays and Python lists, highlighting the performance benefits and use cases of NumPy arrays.

3. **Creating NumPy Arrays**  
   Various methods to create NumPy arrays, including array initialization and converting other data structures to arrays.

4. **NumPy Array Using NumPy Functions**  
   Utilizing built-in NumPy functions to create and manipulate arrays.

5. **NumPy Array with Random Numbers**  
   Generating arrays of random numbers and understanding the use of the random module in NumPy.

6. **Datatype of NumPy Arrays**  
   Understanding the various data types available in NumPy and how to work with them.

7. **NumPy Arithmetic Operations**  
   Performing basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with arrays.

8. **Arithmetic Functions in NumPy**  
   Exploring built-in arithmetic functions such as `max`, `min`, `argmin`, `argmax`, and more.

9. **Shape and Reshaping in NumPy**  
   Understanding the shape of arrays and how to reshape them without changing the data.

10. **Broadcasting in NumPy Array**  
    Learning about broadcasting, a powerful mechanism that allows NumPy to work with arrays of different shapes during arithmetic operations.
