# NumPy Learning Notebooks ðŸ“’

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks with various aspects of using the NumPy library in Python. Each notebook is self-contained and focuses on a specific topic within NumPy, starting from the basics and moving towards more complex operations.

## Notebooks

1. **What is NumPy in Python?**  
   Introduction to NumPy and its significance in scientific computing.

2. **NumPy Array vs Python List**  
   A comparison between NumPy arrays and Python lists, highlighting the performance benefits and use cases of NumPy arrays.

3. **Creating NumPy Arrays**  
   Various methods to create NumPy arrays, including array initialization and converting other data structures to arrays.

4. **NumPy Array Using NumPy Functions**  
   Utilizing built-in NumPy functions to create and manipulate arrays.

5. **NumPy Array with Random Numbers**  
   Generating arrays of random numbers and understanding the use of the random module in NumPy.

6. **Datatype of NumPy Arrays**  
   Understanding the various data types available in NumPy and how to work with them.

7. **NumPy Arithmetic Operations**  
   Performing basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with arrays.

8. **Arithmetic Functions in NumPy**  
   Exploring built-in arithmetic functions such as `max()`, `min()`, `argmin()`, `argmax()`, `sqrt()`, `sin()`, `cumsum()` and more.

9. **Shape and Reshaping in NumPy**  
   Understanding the shape of arrays and how to reshape them without changing the data.

10. **Broadcasting in NumPy Array**  
    Learning about broadcasting, a powerful mechanism that allows NumPy to work with arrays of different shapes during arithmetic operations.
    
11. **Indexing and Slicing in NumPy Arrays**  
    Dive deep into indexing and slicing to manipulate NumPy array elements 

12. **Iterating NumPy Arrays**  
    Learn how to iterate over NumPy arrays using `nditer()`, `ndenumerate()`.

12. **Copy vs Views in NumPy**  
    Understanding the difference between copying and viewing arrays and their implications using `copy()` and `view()`.

12. **Joining & Splitting NumPy Arrays**  
    Techniques for concatenating and splitting arrays using various functions like `concatenate()`, `stack()`, `hstack()`, `dstack()`, `vstack()` and `split()`.

12. **NumPy Array Functions**  
    Exploreed a range of functions for array manipulation, `where()`, `sort()`, `searchsorted()`, `shuffle()`, `unique()`, `resize`, `flatten()` and `ravel()`

12. **NumPy Insert and Delete Arrays Functions**  
    Learnt how to insert and delete elements in arrays efficiently using `insert()`, `append()`, and `delete()`
